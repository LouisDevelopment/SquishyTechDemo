# Squishy

This game is going to be a pet trainer / virtual pet game. Revolving around "Squishy", a round, plush-like character, who you can play with, take on walks, feed and more. The idea came from a plush toy that my partner bought me, I'll throw it up in the air and catch it and its really easy to squish it, so it got the name Squishy. I've been looking to start a long term programming project for a while, to help with job applications once I graduate, and I love this game idea, so I'll be working on it for the next year or so.
